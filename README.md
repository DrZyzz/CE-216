In order to upload the files under the maximum size limit, build and language files were subtracted from the "Release (source code + gradle build files).zip" and
added into "Gradle Executable.rar". 

To build and run Gradle files properly, "Language Files" folder from "Gradle Executable.zip\Gradle Build Files\bin" is needed to be added into root directory 
of the "demo3" folder.
